# Racing Game

*Short explanation of the project (1-2 sentences) - what is the goal of the project and/or main functionality?
*This racing game is supposed to be racing Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel.  The upper-track is supposed to represent Paul Simon's character and race-path while Art Garfunkel's is represented in the bottom. This is a two player game, with the "a" key moving Simon and the quote key, '' , moving Art. It counts up to 12, the first person to reach 12 wins, and an icon representing Simon and Art is supposed to be placed on the board upon player's move. However, much of it became broken.  What I really was trying to focus on, but go carried away on, was using a Constructor to create each player along with their properties (the count, icon-image, and position on the board). *

## Technologies Used

* 
- BootStrap 
-JavaScript
-jQuery 
*

## Existing Features

*
- Counts each players move based on keypressing the a and '' key.
-Plays until a player reaches 12
-Toggles / adds the player's icon to the board
*

## Planned Features

*
(The whole thing can use much more work. I got carried away trying to make ir so it creates the object(player) and it's properties in as short as I could. Didn't work out wholly) 
-A Constructor and protocall to make each player and their properties 
-Implement better icons that are aesthetically pleasing/appealing and actually work by appearing the disappearing 
-Adding instructions to the site/game itself
-Multiple Rounds
-Less buggier reset button
